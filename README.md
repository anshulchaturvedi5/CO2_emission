# Real-time CO2 Emission Data Processing with Apache Kafka

This project presents a comprehensive demonstration of leveraging Apache Kafka for real-time CO2 emission data generation, processing, and visualization. The system is designed to simulate, process, and visualize CO2 emission data in real-time using a series of interconnected components.

## Features

1. **Data Generation**: Simulated CO2 emission data is generated using Faker in the producer code.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Generated data is ingested into Kafka topics for real-time processing.
3. **Data Processing**: A consumer code retrieves the data from Kafka topics and stores it in a CSV file.
4. **Data Conversion**: An API converts the CSV data into JSON format.
5. **Data Visualization**: The JSON data is served to a web interface that uses graphical representations to visualize the real-time CO2 emission data.
6. **Real-time Updates**: The web interface calls the API every two seconds to dynamically refresh the data and ensure up-to-date information.

## Tech Stack

### Client
- **React.js**

### Server
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Apache Kafka**

### Libraries and APIs
- **Faker**: For generating simulated data.
- **Pandas**: For CSV manipulation.
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization.

## Steps to Execute

1. **Setting Up Apache Kafka**
   - Install Apache Kafka on your system by downloading it from the [official Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
   - Follow the Kafka documentation to start the Zookeeper server and Kafka broker(s) on your local machine.

2. **Creating Kafka Topics**
   - Use the Kafka command-line tools to create Kafka topics where the CO2 emission data will be ingested.
   - Define appropriate configurations for the topics, such as the number of partitions and replication factor.

3. **Implementing Producer Code**
   - Develop a producer code using a programming language like Python.
   - Utilize the Faker library to generate random CO2 emission data.
   - Configure the producer to send this data to the Kafka topics created earlier.

4. **Implementing Consumer Code**
   - Develop a consumer code using the same programming language as the producer.
   - Configure the consumer to subscribe to the Kafka topics and retrieve the CO2 emission data.
   - Process the data as required, such as storing it in a CSV file.

5. **Developing API**
   - Choose a framework like Flask (Python) to develop the API.
   - Implement endpoints to read the CO2 emission data from the CSV file and convert it into JSON format.
   - Set up API endpoints to serve this JSON data to the web interface.

6. **Creating Web Interface**
   - Design a web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Implement logic to call the API endpoints at regular intervals (every two seconds) to fetch the real-time CO2 emission data.
   - Utilize graphical representations (e.g., charts, graphs) to visualize the data dynamically on the web interface.

7. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test each component of the system individually to ensure they function correctly.
   - Debug any issues encountered during testing, such as data ingestion or processing errors.

8. **Integration and Deployment**
   - Integrate all components of the system together (producer, consumer, API, web interface).
   - Deploy the system on a server or cloud platform, ensuring it is accessible to users.
   - Monitor the system for any performance issues or errors post-deployment.

9. **Documentation**
   - Document the project thoroughly, including setup instructions, code explanations, and usage guidelines.
   - Provide clear documentation on how to interact with the web interface and interpret the visualized CO2 emission data.

10. **Maintenance and Updates**
    - Regularly maintain and update the system to address any bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance optimizations.
    - Stay informed about new developments in Apache Kafka and related technologies to incorporate improvements into the project.

This project underscores Kafka's efficacy for real-time data streaming applications, demonstrating an end-to-end process from data generation to visualization.
